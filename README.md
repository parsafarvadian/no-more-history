# no-more-history
ðŸ”Ž **A chrome extension that automatically deletes your browsing history after you exit the page.**
I think we all know why I made this :)
## How to install
1. Download the entire repo and extract the .zip file.
2. Open chrome://extensions in your browser.
3. Click "Load unpacked" at the top left corner.
## How to use
1. Click on the extension icon at the top right corner. (You might need to click the puzzle piece icon first)
2. Click on the square next to "enabled" to toggle the extension on or off.
### DISCLAIMER
This is my first extension so there might be some bugs, also the extension clears your ENTIRE browsing history so make sure you are fine with that.
